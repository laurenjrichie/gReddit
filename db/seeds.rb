# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 5.times do
#   Post.create([{
#     name: Faker::Company.bs,
#     content: Faker::Lorem.paragraph,
#     author: Faker::Name.name,
#     }])
#   end
